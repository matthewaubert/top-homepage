# Advanced HTML/CSS: Homepage

This project was built as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage">The Odin Project: Advanced HTML/CSS course</a> in order to practice the advanced HTML and CSS concepts I've learned in this course, including animation, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Understanding the Problem

Create a responsive homepage, something I might find on a portfolio site of sorts. Reference the given design brief. It should look nice at _any_ screen size.

## Plan

1. Set up and planning
   - <a href="https://gist.github.com/matthewaubert/0d52f8d091566bf553491cc88e7e3ccb">Project startup</a>
   - Set up HTML and CSS files
   - Download full-res copy of the three design files

2. Gather assets
   - Download the portraits from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a>
   - Include my fonts: `Playfair Display` and `Roboto` from Google Fonts
   - Download icons for GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter from <a href="https://devicon.dev/">devicon.dev</a>
   - Download other icons (phone, email, external link) as SVGs from <a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">devicon.dev</a>

3. Build homepage
   - Start out by getting the various sections (e.g. header, projects, contact, etc.) in more or less the right place
   - Then, work from top to bottom of page, filling in, styling, and cleaning up everything
